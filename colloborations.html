                          <p>Oxyponics was conceived in the summer of 2017 by Cornell iGEM -  a synthetic biology engineering project team composed of 36 undergraduate students. The company created a toolkit to optimize redox state by controlling the amount of reactive oxygen species in the environment. Utilizing the research conducted by the team throughout 2017, Oxyponics created a novel biosensor that couples a redox-sensitive fluorescent protein and an optogenetic circuit to a spectrometric receiver. This allows for a dual reporter-response functionality that greatly enhances versatility and sensitivity over traditional biosensor systems. With the development of an effective large-scale sensing system to monitor plants and track data, the optimal level of oxidative stress that can be determined for the plant systems. Members of the team communicated with local farmers to learn more about Through the feedback of farmers themselves, we created Oxyponics, which couples fluorescent bacteria with a camera-rail system for imaging, to provide exactly the large-scale blanket-type sensing that conventional redox probes cannot.

              As a team of only undergraduates, we conceived this concept on our own and have worked on it from start to finish.  Our wet lab team cloned the redox-sensitive fluorescent proteins, ROS scavengers, and light-sensitive promoters and other redox-related proteins into pSB1C3.  The team also tested the pDawn and pDusk system and characterized the redox-sensitive fluorescent proteins coupled with the ROS scavengers. Dry lab designed, 3D printed, and prototyped the camera system with the plastic planter cups filled with wet lab’s bacteria using materials and funding from REV and Cornell’s College of Engineering. The team also tested our project in Cornell greenhouses and PureSpinach’s own plants. Policies and practices led and organized the numerous outreach programs directed to the youth and the wider public. The team met with and reached out to a diverse array of researchers, and hydroponics growers for ideation and implementation of our project. To understand how the the project fit into society, the team conducted surveys and met with lawmakers and educators.
