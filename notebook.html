          <b>P&P:</b> Product development and P&P continued to interview hydroponic growers. The team received important feedback from them, including their needs. One key theme we found in our interviews was a need for a simple, continuous, real-time monitoring system. Furthermore, they learned that there were several sources of abiotic stress, including excess heat, insects, humidity, and pH fluctuations. They also found that many hydroponic growers were open to testing new methods and technology. The group also reached out to the Rasheed Hislop Community Garden in New York City to consider the ramifications of placing genetically-engineered bacteria in such close proximity to people’s food. While it isn’t common, team members did find that some hydroponic growers, such as those at
          Terrapin Farms in Maryland, do use bacteria in their setup to provide benefits to crops.
